= PUPPI LOG README
Documentation and examples related to the puppi action log

== SYNOPSIS (cli)
        puppi log [topic] [-i]

== EXAMPLES (cli)
puppi log : Tails (tail -10f) all the known logs. 
puppi log apache : Tails only the logs related to the given topic
puppi log -i : Choose interactively which logs to show
puppi log -g <string> : Grep the output with the string defined

== EXAMPLES (puppet)
The basic define related to a log is:
puppi::log   - Creates a file with one or more logs paths.

A simple, operating system aware, example might be:
        puppi::log { "auth":
            description => "Users and authentication" ,
            log => $operatingsystem ? { 
                redhat => "/var/log/secure",
                darwin => "/var/log/secure.log",
                ubuntu => ["/var/log/user.log","/var/log/auth.log"],
        }

but also something that uses variables Puppet already knows
        puppi::log { "tomcat-${instance_name}":
            log => "${tomcat::params::storedir}/${instance_name}/logs/catalina.out"
        }

EXAMPLES (with example42 puppet modules)
If you use the whole Example42 modules set you get automatically many service related logs out of the box.
Just set (via an ENC, facts or manifests) these puppet variables:
$puppi=yes # To enable puppi extensions autoloading
