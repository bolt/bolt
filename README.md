Bolt
====

Sophisticated, lightweight & simple CMS. Homepage: [Bolt.cm](https://bolt.cm)

Bolt is a tool for Content Management, which strives to be as simple and
straightforward as possible. It is quick to set up, easy to configure, uses
elegant templates, and above all: It's a joy to use. Bolt is created using
modern open source libraries, and is best suited to build sites in HTML5 with
modern markup.

From a technical perspective: Bolt is written in PHP, and uses either SQLite,
MySQL or PostgreSQL as a database. It's built upon the [Silex framework](http://silex.sensiolabs.org)
together with a number of [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) [components](http://symfony.com/components)
and [other libraries](http://docs.bolt.cm/credits). Bolt is released under the
open source [MIT-license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

#### Yeoman Generator

[Tight](https://github.com/pinpickle/tight) 

Tighten that Bolt! This generator will set up Bolt for you with a local extension 
and a feature-packed theme ready for you to make the best website the world has yet seen.

**Note:** This is not designed to be a "ready-to-deploy" theme. It is designed to 
be barebones boilerplate so you can get to making what you need to make.

Reporting issues
----------------
When you run into an issue, be sure to provide some details on the issue.
Please include with your report:

This way we can reproduce your issue, turn it into a test and prevent the issue
