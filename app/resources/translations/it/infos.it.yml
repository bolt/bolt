            Use this field to upload a photo or image. Click the button to upload a file from your
            computer, or if you're using a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, you can simply drag'n'drop the file
            from your desktop or from a different browser window.<br>
            Alternatively, you can use a previously uploaded image. To select a previously uploaded file, just
            type (part) of the file name in the input area, and it will be autocompleted.

            of Chrome or Firefox, you can simply drag'n'drop the file from your desktop or from a different

        filelist: |
            Use this field to upload multiple files and some descriptions. Like with the singular "file" field, recent
            browser versions are able to understand you dragging a file into the input field. Maybe give it a try?
        filesmall: |
            Use the button to upload a file. To select a previously uploaded file, you can
            type (part) of the file name in the input area, and it will be autocompleted.
        imagelist: |
            Use this field to upload a set of photos or image. Click the button to upload a file from your
            computer, or if you're using a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, you can simply drag'n'drop the file
            from your desktop or from a different browser window.<br>
            Alternatively, you can use a previously uploaded image.<br>
            You can rearrange the images using drag'n'drop, and change the descriptions of the images.
        video: |
            Use this field to embed a video inside a page on the website. Just copy/paste the
            URL of a video-page on Youtube, Vimeo or almost any other video sharing website.<br>
            Bolt will automatically fetch the &lt;embed&gt;-code, with the correct width, height and the original
            title. If you change the width or height, the other value will change accordingly, to maintain the
            aspect ratio.
    geolocation: |
        Use this field to get the geolocation of any address, or place the marker
        manually by dragging the pin. First, enter an (approximate) address in the 'address'-field,
        and the corresponding latitude and longitude will be retrieved using the Google Maps API,
        together with the closest matching address, according to Google.<br>
        If you want to move the marker to a different location, just drag'n'drop the pin on the
        mini-map. The latitude and longitude will be updated automatically.
    markdown: |
        Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
        <p>Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format,
        which is then converted to structurally valid HTML.</p>
        <p><strong>Quick reference:</strong><br>
        # This is an &lt;h1&gt;-tag<br>
        ## This is an &lt;h2&gt;-tag<br>
        ###### This is an &lt;h6&gt;-tag</p>
        <p>This _<em>is italic</em>_, this __<strong>is bold</strong>__, and this
        ___<em><strong>is both</strong></em>___. You can also use asterisks: This *<em>is italic</em>*,
        this **<strong>is bold</strong>**.
        <p>Create <a href='#'>links</a> like this:<br>
        An [exciting website](http://example.org/ &quot;Title of link&quot;)</p>
        <p>&nbsp; * This is an unordered list<br>
        &nbsp; * Item 2</p>
        <p>&nbsp; 1 This is an ordered list<br>
        &nbsp; 2 Item 2</p>
    relationships: |
        By selecting other records as a 'relation', you are actually
        creating a link between this record, and the one you selected. On the
        website, this can by used for 'related articles', 'see also' or to display
        how this record fits into a certain structure.
    taxonomy: |
        By selecting one or more taxonomies for this record,
        you are classifying this record to have those properties. On the
        website this can be used to group certain records together, or
        to automatically create links to records that share a
        classification.
