# Warning: Translations are in the process of being moved to a new keyword-based translation
#          at the moment. This is an ongoing process. Translations currently in the 
#          repository are automatically mapped to the new scheme. Be aware that there 
#          can be a race condition between that process and your PR so that it's 
#          eventually necessary to remap your translations. If you're planning on 
#          updating your translations, it's best to ask on IRC to time your contribution
#          in order to prevent merge conflicts.
