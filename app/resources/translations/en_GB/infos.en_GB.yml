            computer, or if you're using a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, you can simply drag'n'drop the file
            from your desktop or from a different browser window.<br/>
            Alternatively, you can use a previously uploaded image. To select a previously uploaded file, just
            type (part) of the file name in the input area, and it will be autocompleted.

            website. Click the button to upload a file from your computer, or if you're using a recent version
            of Chrome or Firefox, you can simply drag'n'drop the file from your desktop or from a different

        filelist: |
            Use this field to upload multiple files and some descriptions. Like with the singular "file" field, recent
            browser versions are able to understand you dragging a file into the input field. Maybe give it a try?
        filesmall: |

            type (part) of the file name in the input area, and it will be autocompleted.
        imagelist: |
            Use this field to upload a set of photos or image. Click the button to upload a file from your
                computer, or if you're using a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, you can simply drag'n'drop the file
                from your desktop or from a different browser window. <br />
                Alternatively, you can use a previously uploaded image. <br />
                You can rearrange the images using drag'n'drop, and change the descriptions of the images.
        video: |
            Use this field to embed a video inside a page on the website. Just copy/paste the
                  URL of a video-page on Youtube, Vimeo or almost any other video sharing website. <br>
                  Bolt will automatically fetch the &amp;lt;embed&amp;gt;-code, with the correct width, height and the original
                  title. If you change the width or height, the other value will change accordingly, to maintain the
                  aspect ratio.
    geolocation: |
        Use this field to get the geolocation of any address, or place the marker
            manually by dragging the pin. First, enter an (approximate) address in the 'address'-field,
            and the corresponding latitude and longitude will be retrieved using the Google Maps API,
            together with the closest matching address, according to Google. <br>
            If you want to move the marker to a different location, just drag'n'drop the pin on the
            mini-map. The latitude and longitude will be updated automatically.
    markdown: |
        Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
            <p>Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format,
            which is then converted to structurally valid HTML.</p>
            <p><strong>Quick reference:</strong><br>
            # This is an &lt;h1&gt;-tag<br>
            ## This is an &lt;h2&gt;-tag<br>
            ###### This is an &lt;h6&gt;-tag</p>
            <p>This _<em>is italic</em>_, this __<strong>is bold</strong>__, and this
            ___<em><strong>is both</strong></em>___. You can also use asterisks: This *<em>is italic</em>*,
            this **<strong>is bold</strong>**.
            <p>Create <a href='#'>links</a> like this:<br>
            An [exciting website](http://example.org/ &amp;quot;Title of link&amp;quot;)</p>
            <p>&nbsp; * This is an unordered list<br>
            &nbsp; * Item 2</p>
            <p>&nbsp; 1 This is an ordered list<br>
            &nbsp; 2 Item 2</p>
    relationships: |
        By selecting other records as a 'relation', you are actually
            creating a link between this record, and the one you selected. On the
            website, this can by used for 'related articles', 'see also' or to display
            how this record fits into a certain structure.
    taxonomy: |
        By selecting one or more taxonomies for this record,
                  you are classifying this record to have those properties. On the
                  website this can be used to group certain records together, or
                  to automatically create links to records that share a
                  classification.
