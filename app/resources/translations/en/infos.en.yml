            which is then converted to structurally valid HTML.</p>
            <p><strong>Quick reference:</strong><br>
            # This is an &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; tag<br>
            ## This is an &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt; tag<br>
            ###### This is an &amp;lt;h6&amp;gt; tag</p>
            <p>This _<em>is italic</em>_, this __<strong>is bold</strong>__, and this
            ___<em><strong>is both</strong></em>___. You can also use asterixes: This *<em>is italic</em>*,
            this **<strong>is bold</strong>**.
            <p>Create <a href='#'>links</a> like this:<br>
            An [exciting website](http://example.org/ &amp;quot;Title of link&amp;quot;)</p>
            <p>&nbsp; * This is an unordered list<br>
            &nbsp; * Item 2</p>
            <p>&nbsp; 1 This is an ordered list<br>
            &nbsp; 2 Item 2</p>
    relationships: |
        By selecting other records as a 'relation', you are actually
            creating a link between this record, and the one you selected. On the
            website, this can by used for 'related articles', 'see also' or to display
            how this record fits into a certain structure.
    taxonomy: |
        By selecting one or more taxonomies for this record,
                  you are classifying this record to have those properties. On the
                  website this can be used to group certain records together, or
                  to automatically create links to records that share a
                  classification.
