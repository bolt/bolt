# - duration: the duration (in minutes) for the 'templates' and 'request' options. default is 10 minutes.
#   note that the duration is set on storing the cache. By lowering this value you will not invalidate
#   currently cached items.
# - authenticated: cache 'templates' and 'request' for logged-on users. In most cases you should *NOT* enable
