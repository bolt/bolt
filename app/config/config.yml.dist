# Settings for caching in parts of Bolt.
# - config:        Caches the parsed .yml files from /app/config. It's updated
#                  immediately when one of the files changes on disk. There
#                  should be no good reason to turn this off.
#
# - templates:     Caches rendered templates.
#
# - request:       Caches rendered pages in the configured HTTP reverse proxy
#                  cache, on GET & HEAD requests.
#                  By default this is handled by Syfmony HTTP Cache.
#
# - duration:      The duration (in minutes) for the 'templates' and 'request'
#                  options. default is 10 minutes. Note that the duration is set
#                  on storing the cache. By lowering this value you will not
#                  invalidate currently cached items.
#
# - authenticated: Cache 'templates' and 'request' for logged-on users. In most
#                  cases you should *NOT* enable this, because it will cause
#                  side-effects if the website shows different content to
#                  authenticated users.
#
# - thumbnails:    Caches thumbnail generation.
#
# - translations:  Caches translation files. It is recommend to leave this
#                  enabled. Only if you develop extensions and work with
#                  translation files you should turn this off.
