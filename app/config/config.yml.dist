#                  should be no good reason to turn this off.
# - templates:     Caches rendered templates.
# - request:       Caches entire rendered pages like '/page/about', but only on 
#                  GET requests.
# - duration:      The duration (in minutes) for the 'templates' and 'request'
#                  options. default is 10 minutes. Note that the duration is set
#                  on storing the cache. By lowering this value you will not
#                  invalidate currently cached items.
# - authenticated: Cache 'templates' and 'request' for logged-on users. In most
#                  cases you should *NOT* enable this, because it will cause
